Simple application where we practice building a module application in our webservice course

The application is a simple Cipher, where you can type in some text and then choose a cipher to encode your text


To use the application run the following command to download the image:
docker pull mikaeledwartz/webservice:moduleapp

and then run it with the command:
docker run -i mikaeledwartz/webservice:moduleapp
